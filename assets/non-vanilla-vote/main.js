Increasing the insomnia threshold (eg to 6 days instead of 3) would be a better change, as it would at least reduce the amount that players have to tolerate them without flat-out removing them. I believe if you did a simple poll asking 'do you want phantoms disabled', it would be an overwhelming majority for yes, but if you can't do that, at least reduce them instead of trying to plaster over them without making any change to their individual effect on the player.
